# 3-in-2-clock

> &#39;3 in 2&#39; is a fun game for summer camps where the whole camp experiences three whole (and otherwise normal) days in the time of two real days. You simply pretend that time passes more quickly. All you need is a clock running faster.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

```
